App to identify trees!

To do:

- Add information about the tree immediately following the it being presented, e.g. link to a web page
- Improve front end
- Allow for null results 'I don't know what this tree is'
- Use tta_aug instead of make preds to improve the result
- Improve accuracy of the model, some ideas:

  - use confusion matrix to examine trees it struggles with and then use gather more data on them, think about why it might struggle?
  - more data
